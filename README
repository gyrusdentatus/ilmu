This repository will house the guix system that will seed the "tala saman" network.

Tala saman is my attempt at implementing datalisp, feel free to make more convincing attempts.

The word "vegur" both means "road" or "path" and it also means "one who assesses" or "weighing" finally it also means to kill someone but only in the Icelandic sagas.

I feel all meanings are quite appropriate since all this bureaucracy is killing the human spirit, we should stop spending so much time staring at symbols.

Anyway, feel free to participate and help me reach escape velocity.
